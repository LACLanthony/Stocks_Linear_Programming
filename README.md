Portfolio Investment Risk Modeling

A financial analyst has 150,000 to invest in the stock market and is considering investments in six stocks with teh following current projectedt rates of return:

* Tech Stocks: Cisco (8%), Microsoft (6%), and Intel (5%)
* Bank Stocks: BofA (7%), First Bank (4%)
* Money Market: ING (2%)

The risk measure based on the historical volatility of the investments are:

* Tech Stocks: Cisco (14.02%), Microsoft (10.57%), and Intel (13.22%)
* Bank Stocks: BofA (9.36%), First Bank (7.61%)
* Money Market: ING (2.39%)

An investment company recommends the following:

* At least as much in bank stocks as in tech stocks
* No more than 80,000 in any stock
* at least 50,000 in money market (ING)

The invesor would like to have an average return of at least 8% but would like to minimize the risk. Given what we know, what would achieve this?
